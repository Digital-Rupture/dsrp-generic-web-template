## 🛠️ Getting Started

To begin a new project using this structure, please use the **"Use this template"** button on the main repository page (if viewing on GitHub). This will clone the structure and reset the commit history, giving you a clean slate.

### 1. Project Setup

After cloning the new repository, follow these steps:

1.  **Update `README.md`:** Replace this introductory content with specific details about your new project, including its purpose, technologies, and unique setup requirements.
2.  **Initialize:** If using Node.js, run `npm init` or `npm install` in your root directory.
3.  **Start Coding:** Place your primary application files in the relevant directories (`/src`, `/public`).

### 2. Directory Structure

This template uses a standardized structure suitable for most modern web applications:

| Directory | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`src/`** | Contains all application source code, components, and core logic. |
| **`public/`** | Stores static assets, including the main `index.html` file, images, and fonts. |
| **`docs/`** | Dedicated folder for detailed project documentation, architectural diagrams, and user guides. |
| **`.github/`** | Configuration files for GitHub Actions, CI/CD, and issue templates. |

#### 🛡️ Risk Analysis & Security Register

This document provides a formal **Risk Register** detailing potential security vulnerabilities (categorized by the **CIA Triad**) inherent to the template elements and outlining the mitigation strategy, whether applied in the template or **Deferred to the Backend/Infrastructure**.

This guide explains the "why" behind the template's choices, merging **security controls** (the **CIA Triad**) with the **DSRP** principles of structural thinking. This is the recommended starting point for new developers using this template.
